<h1>Starter Project</h1>
<p>Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into modding for Sid Meier's Civilization VI.
These starter projects are designed to be a turn-key solution that you can use immediately.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Before you are able to use your mod, you must first build it.
To build the mod, click on the &quot;BUILD&quot; option in the top menu and select &quot;Build Solution&quot;.  Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+Shift+B (assuming you haven't changed the defaults).
This will copy content into <My Documents>/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/'.</p>
<h2>Trying it all out</h2>
<p>First, let's make sure the mod is installed.
Start up Civilization VI and navigate to &quot;Additional Content&quot;.
Under the list of installed mods, you should now see your newly created mod.
Ensure the mod is marked as 'enabled'.</p>
<p>Create a new game and enjoy the results!</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>The starter mods provide basic files to perform the task described in the project description.
Double clicking on these files in the solution explorer will allow you to view and possibly modify them.</p>
<p>If you wish to add new files to the mod, right click on the Mod in the solution explorer and select &quot;Add-&gt;Add New Item...&quot;.</p>
